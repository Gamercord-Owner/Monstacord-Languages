# Monstacord-Languages
Language files used for Monstacord. Public so that others can make pull requests to add new languages or fix existing translation issues

For those who want to collaborate/translate for us, the current language files are here. If there is an error, or you wish to add a new language - submit a pull request here!

There are additional tools in this repository. addKey.sh/.js will not help you, but the validator will ensure that a given language file is valid.

**PLEASE RETAIN DISCORD MARKUP FORMATTING, NEW LINE CHARACTERS, AND ARGS**
- Args are defined like `{0}`,`{1}`,`{2}` OR without a number. Each one corresponds to a name/value that is passed in and formatted to replace those `{0}`.

**DO NOT USE GOOGLE TRANSLATE** - Translation tools often do not understand context, so it can create an incorrect translation. For example, the English word `level` can mean both a number representing a status in a game, or it can mean when something is even on a wall.

Please contact the @Admins to get added to #translation-collaboration to collaborate/share translations before being published.

Gift for completed language file: 3 redeems(given manually, contact @Bot Owners ), and 50K coins
